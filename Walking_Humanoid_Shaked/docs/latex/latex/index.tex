This application simulates a walking humanoid in a 3D real-\/physics environment. The floor can oscillate in roll or pitch direction with a sinusoidal wave. The software includes\+: the Physics Engine (Newton Dynamics) provided by Dave Gravel; the humanoid model composed of\+: rigid bodies, musculo-\/tendon units, PD regulators, and gait control logic; optimization routine based on Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolutionary Strategy (\mbox{\hyperlink{class_c_m_a_e_s}{CMAES}}) by Nikolaus Hansen, ported to C++ by Alexander Fabisch.

\end{DoxyEnumerate}\hypertarget{index_purpose}{}\doxysection{General Purpose}\label{index_purpose}
The software should be used to simulate working environments where whole-\/body vibration is a risk factor for human health. Thhanks to the siumulation, it is possible to measure gait parameters change due to \mbox{\hyperlink{class_w_b_v}{WBV}}. ~\newline
\hypertarget{index_application}{}\doxysection{Application Remark}\label{index_application}
In this version, \mbox{\hyperlink{class_w_b_v}{WBV}} can be selected as sinusoidal waveform along roll or pitch direction. Further release should be include WVB along all the 6 axes.

The window can crash on exit. In this case it is necessary to force stop the app. \hypertarget{index_links}{}\doxysection{Links}\label{index_links}

Run \char`\"{}\+Walking\+\_\+\+Humanoid\+\_\+\+Shaked.\+exe\char`\"{} the to see the simulation. The .exe file returns the \char`\"{}cost\char`\"{} of the simulation, which is a numeric value that quantifies the quality of the simulation (low value -\/\texorpdfstring{$>$}{>} the model walks, high value-\/\texorpdfstring{$>$}{>} the model falls). Details on how the \char`\"{}cost\char`\"{} is computed in Info section.

The .exe takes data from three files\+:


\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item Configuration.\+xml the settings are\+: . \char`\"{}\+Simulation\+Time\char`\"{} is the simulation length in seconds, . \char`\"{}\+Optimization\char`\"{} activates the optimization routine based on \mbox{\hyperlink{class_c_m_a_e_s}{CMAES}} genetic algorithm. This setting can be \char`\"{}no\char`\"{} or \char`\"{}yes\char`\"{}, . \char`\"{}\+Iterations\+Number\char`\"{} is the number of iterations of the \mbox{\hyperlink{class_c_m_a_e_s}{CMAES}} algorithm, . \char`\"{}\+Output\char`\"{} writes simulation data to a .txt file (Gait\+\_\+timeseries.\+txt). This setting can be \char`\"{}no\char`\"{} or \char`\"{}yes\char`\"{}, . \char`\"{}\+Active\char`\"{} is related to Whole-\/\+Body Vibration\+: if \char`\"{}yes\char`\"{} the floor oscillates, if \char`\"{}no\char`\"{} the floor does not move, . \char`\"{}\+Direction\char`\"{} is the direction of sinusoidal \mbox{\hyperlink{class_w_b_v}{WBV}} (roll or pitch), . \char`\"{}\+Amplitude\char`\"{} is the amplitude in degrees of the \mbox{\hyperlink{class_w_b_v}{WBV}} wave, . \char`\"{}\+Frequency\char`\"{} is the frequency of the \mbox{\hyperlink{class_w_b_v}{WBV}} wave in Hz.
\item Optimization\+Parameters.\+xml

This file contains the parameter of the model that could change in presence of \mbox{\hyperlink{class_w_b_v}{WBV}}. At the end of an optimization routine, the file will contain two sets of parameters, the initial and optimized.
\item Dummy\+Geometric\+Properties.\+xml

This file contains the humanoid parameters that are not optimized.
